##Legal Summary: Oracle v. Google (Java APIs)

In the landmark case Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc. (2021), 
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Google’s use of approximately
11,500 lines of declaring code and the Structure, Sequence, and
Organization (SSO) from the Java SE SDK was fair use as a matter of law.
While the Court avoided a final ruling on whether APIs are copyrightable
at all, it established that reimplementing an interface to allow for
interoperability and to leverage the "accrued talents" of developers
is transformative and legally protected.

###Protection and Fair Use
The Court emphasized that "declaring code"—the functional headers used
to call subroutines—differs from "implementing code," which contains the actual logic. Because declaring code is inherently functional and serves as a "key" to unlock programmer creativity, it receives thinner protection under copyright law.

Under the Fair Use Doctrine, copying these interfaces is generally
protected when:

Transformative: It creates a new platform or environment 
(e.g., moving from desktop to mobile).

Functional: The code is used to enable compatibility rather than just
to bypass writing original logic.

Minimal: Only the necessary "declaring" lines are used, representing a
tiny fraction of the total codebase.
